XML is a widely-used markup language that defines a set of rules 
for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable 
and machine-readable. XML is designed to be self-descriptive and 
platform-independent, making it suitable for various applications, 
including data exchange between different systems and 
the representation of structured data.


Key features of XML include:


Extensibility: XML allows users to define their own custom markup tags and 
document structures, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications.


Hierarchical Structure: XML documents are structured as a tree of elements, 
with one root element containing nested child elements. 
This hierarchical structure makes it suitable for representing structured data.


Self-Descriptive: Each XML document can include a Document Type Definition (DTD) 
or an XML Schema Definition (XSD) that specifies the structure and 
data types of the elements within the document. This self-descriptive nature 
ensures that the document's content is well-defined and validated.


Text-Based: XML documents are plain text files, which means they can be 
easily created, edited, and read using text editors or specialized XML tools.


Platform-Independent: XML is not tied to any specific programming language 
or operating system, making it suitable for interoperability between 
different software systems and platforms.


Data Exchange: XML is commonly used for data exchange between different 
applications and systems, such as web services, configuration files, 
and data storage formats.


Human-Readable: While XML is primarily designed for machine processing, 
its text-based format is also human-readable, which makes it easier for 
developers to work with and troubleshoot.
