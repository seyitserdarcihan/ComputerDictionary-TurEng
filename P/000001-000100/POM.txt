▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Açıklamalar ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
A pom.xml file is a configuration file used in Apache Maven, 
a widely-used build automation and project management tool 
primarily used for Java projects. The acronym "POM" stands for "Project Object Model" 
The pom.xml file contains essential information about a project, 
its dependencies, build settings, and other project-related metadata.


Some key elements and information typically found in a pom.xml file:


Project Information: This includes details such as the project's 
name, version, description, and organization.


Dependencies: A list of external libraries and dependencies that the project relies on. 
Maven uses this information to automatically download and manage 
these dependencies during the build process.


Build Configuration: Maven allows you to specify how your project should be built, 
including settings for compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying your application.


Plugins: Plugins are used to extend Maven's capabilities. 
They can be configured in the pom.xml file to perform various tasks 
during the build process, such as code generation, reporting, or packaging.


Repositories: Information about where Maven should look for dependencies. 
This includes remote repositories where Maven can download libraries 
if they are not available locally.


Profiles: Profiles allow you to define different sets of configurations 
for different environments or build conditions. 
You can activate specific profiles based on criteria such as 
the development stage or target platform.
